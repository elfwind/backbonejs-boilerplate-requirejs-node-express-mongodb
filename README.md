BackboneJS Boilerplate with RequireJS NodeJS Express and MongoDB


Download nodejs - http://nodejs.org Node provides a JavaScript runtime environment that you can access from your command prompt or terminal. Node will install with a package management (npm) utility, which allows you to install and access third party package libraries and use within your application. To play around with and run this code as is you will need to use the node package manager to install express and socket.io

Install express Open your command prompt or terminal window, change your directory to the folder of your application and type: npm install express

Install socket.io - npm install socket.io

Install mongoDB for windows - http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/

Install mongodb for OSX - http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/

docs.mongodb.org also has a number of other installation and getting started guides

Once everything is installed, you will need to start the mongodb and the node server. To do this I open 2 command prompt/terminal windows and:

In the first window type:
> cd path-to-your-folder\mongodb\bin

> mongod

In the second window type:
> cd path-to-your-folder

> node server
